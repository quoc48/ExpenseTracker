- **Backend:** Supabase for database, auth, and real-time sync
- **Pattern:** MVVM for clear separation of concerns
- **Navigation:** NavigationStack for iOS 16+ compatibility

### Project Structure
- **Monorepo approach:** iOS app + backend config in single repository
- **Documentation-driven:** Comprehensive planning files for session management
- **Session management:** Proactive compact mode prevention with clear handoffs

### Development Workflow
- **Session-based development:** Complete features within conversation limits
- **Incremental commits:** Frequent commits with working code
- **Documentation updates:** Update planning files before ending sessions

## Known Issues 🔍
*No issues yet - project in initial setup phase*

## Blocked Items ⛔
*No blockers currently*

## Session Management Notes 📚

### Conversation Length Monitoring
- **Current exchange count:** ~8 exchanges
- **Session limit target:** 15-20 exchanges
- **Status:** Safe to continue - well within limits

### Compact Mode Prevention
- Session is proceeding well with focused, incremental progress
- Documentation being maintained for clean handoffs
- Next session goals clearly defined

## Development Environment 🛠️
