## Next Priorities 📋

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete iOS project structure setup**
   - Create proper Xcode project structure
   - Set up folder organization per CLAUDE.md guidelines
   - Add initial SwiftUI app skeleton

2. **Finalize Supabase backend configuration**
   - Create backend/README.md with setup instructions
   - Add Supabase configuration files
   - Document environment setup

3. **Create main README.md**
   - Project overview and features
   - Setup instructions for development
   - Link to documentation structure

### Next Session Goals (Session 2) - UPDATED ⭐
**Major Change:** Skip database creation - use existing advanced schema!

1. **iOS Data Models Creation**
   - Create Swift models for existing categories, expenses, user_settings tables
   - Match Vietnamese localization and advanced features (embeddings, metadata)
   - Add proper Codable conformance and UUID handling

2. **Supabase Swift Client Integration** 
   - Install and configure Supabase Swift package
   - Create SupabaseService class with connection management
   - Implement authentication flow

3. **Basic CRUD Operations**
   - CategoryService for managing 14 existing categories
   - ExpenseService for creating/reading expenses
   - Test with existing Vietnamese category data

4. **Simple UI Implementation**
   - Category selection view using existing data
   - Basic expense entry form
   - Test end-to-end flow with real database

## Technical Decisions Made 📝

### Architecture Choices
- **Platform:** iOS with SwiftUI (iOS 16+ target)
- **Backend:** Supabase for database, auth, and real-time sync
- **Pattern:** MVVM for clear separation of concerns
- **Navigation:** NavigationStack for iOS 16+ compatibility

### Project Structure
- **Monorepo approach:** iOS app + backend config in single repository
- **Documentation-driven:** Comprehensive planning files for session management
- **Session management:** Proactive compact mode prevention with clear handoffs

### Development Workflow
- **Session-based development:** Complete features within conversation limits
- **Incremental commits:** Frequent commits with working code
- **Documentation updates:** Update planning files before ending sessions

## Known Issues 🔍
*No issues yet - project in initial setup phase*

## Blocked Items ⛔
*No blockers currently*

## Session Management Notes 📚

### Conversation Length Monitoring
- **Current exchange count:** ~8 exchanges
- **Session limit target:** 15-20 exchanges
- **Status:** Safe to continue - well within limits

### Compact Mode Prevention
- Session is proceeding well with focused, incremental progress
- Documentation being maintained for clean handoffs
- Next session goals clearly defined

## Development Environment 🛠️

### Prerequisites Needed for Next Session
- Xcode (latest version)
- Supabase CLI (for database migrations)
- Git (for version control)
- iOS Simulator for testing

### Environment Variables to Set
```bash
# To be defined in Session 2
SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Code Quality Status 📊

### Standards Compliance
- ✅ Following SwiftUI best practices outlined in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Proper file organization and naming conventions
- ✅ Documentation standards maintained

### Testing Status
- ⏳ No code to test yet (foundation phase)
- 📋 Test strategy defined in PROJECT_PLAN.md

## Notes for Next Session 📝

### What to Read First
1. `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Session 2 goals and database schema
2. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - This file for current progress
3. Latest entry in `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md` - Session 1 summary

### Specific Next Steps
1. Start with database schema design and Supabase table creation
2. Create iOS data models to match database structure  
3. Set up Supabase Swift client integration
4. Implement basic authentication flow

### Success Criteria for Session 2
- [ ] Database schema implemented in Supabase
- [ ] iOS data models created and validated
- [ ] Supabase client successfully integrated
- [ ] Basic auth flow working end-to-end
- [ ] All code committed and documented
