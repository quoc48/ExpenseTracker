- **iOS Setup:** 20% complete (folder structure ready)
- **Backend Setup:** 30% complete (basic Supabase structure exists)

### Challenges Encountered
- None significant - foundation setup proceeding smoothly
- Project structure was already well-organized from initial setup

### Next Session Preparation

#### Session 2 Goals (Database & Data Models)
