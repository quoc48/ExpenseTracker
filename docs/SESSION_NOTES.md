**Goal:** Complete project foundation with documentation, iOS structure, and backend configuration

### Session Objectives ✅
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation structure
- [x] Set up iOS project organization
- [x] Configure Supabase backend basics  
- [x] Create project README

### Completed Tasks

#### Documentation Setup
- **CLAUDE.md:** Already existed with comprehensive development guidelines
  - Session management rules and compact mode prevention
  - SwiftUI best practices and code quality standards
  - Supabase integration patterns
  - File structure and naming conventions

- **PROJECT_PLAN.md:** Created complete roadmap
  - 10-session development plan from foundation to polish
  - Detailed database schema design
  - Phase-based feature development approach
  - Technical architecture and risk mitigation strategies

- **CURRENT_STATE.md:** Created progress tracking system
  - Current completion status and next priorities
  - Session management and conversation monitoring
  - Technical decisions documentation
  - Clear handoff instructions for next session

- **SESSION_NOTES.md:** This file for session logging

#### Project Structure Analysis
- Confirmed existing structure matches CLAUDE.md specifications
- ios/ folder ready for Xcode project creation
- backend/supabase/ structure already initialized
- docs/ folder properly organized

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Architecture Choices Made
1. **iOS Platform:** SwiftUI with iOS 16+ target for modern development
2. **Backend:** Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time sync
3. **Pattern:** MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns
4. **Project Structure:** Monorepo approach for iOS + backend configuration

#### Development Workflow Established
1. **Session Management:** Proactive conversation monitoring (currently ~12 exchanges)
2. **Incremental Development:** Complete features within session limits
3. **Documentation-First:** Maintain planning files for clean handoffs
4. **Quality Standards:** Follow SwiftUI best practices and error handling

### Progress Summary
- **Overall Project:** 15% complete (foundation phase)
- **Documentation:** 100% complete
- **iOS Setup:** 20% complete (folder structure ready)
- **Backend Setup:** 30% complete (basic Supabase structure exists)

### Challenges Encountered
- None significant - foundation setup proceeding smoothly
- Project structure was already well-organized from initial setup

### Next Session Preparation

#### Session 2 Goals (Database & Data Models)
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Create Supabase tables: profiles, budgets, categories, expenses
   - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Create database migration files

2. **iOS Data Models**
   - Create Swift models matching database schema
   - Set up Supabase Swift client integration
   - Implement basic authentication flow

3. **Service Layer Foundation**
   - Create SupabaseService class structure
   - Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Add comprehensive error handling

#### Files to Read in Session 2
1. `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Focus on Session 2 goals and database schema
2. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current progress and immediate priorities  
3. `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md` - This session summary

#### Success Criteria for Session 2
- Database schema fully implemented in Supabase
- iOS data models created and validated
- Supabase client successfully connected
- Basic authentication flow working
- All code committed with proper documentation

### Code Quality Notes
- Following established SwiftUI patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Maintaining proper file organization and naming
- Documentation standards consistently applied

### Session Management Status
- **Current Exchange Count:** ~12 exchanges
- **Target Limit:** 15-20 exchanges  
- **Status:** On track - will complete remaining foundation tasks and end session cleanly

### Major Discovery: Existing Database Schema ⭐
**Unexpected Bonus:** Found 3 pre-existing tables in Supabase:
- **categories** (14 Vietnamese categories with icons/colors)
- **expenses** (comprehensive with AI embeddings and metadata)  
- **user_settings** (user preferences)

This advanced schema exceeds our planned requirements and includes:
- ✅ AI/ML capabilities (embeddings column)
- ✅ Rich metadata support
- ✅ Vietnamese localization
- ✅ Performance optimization (denormalized data)
- ✅ Multi-user architecture

### Final Tasks Completed ✅
- [x] Complete iOS project structure setup
- [x] Finalize Supabase backend configuration
- [x] Create main README.md
- [x] Connect and verify Supabase database
- [x] Analyze existing database schema
- [x] Document existing table structures
- [x] Session summary and handoff preparation

## Session 2: iOS Data Models & Supabase Integration
**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Duration:** Complete ✅  
**Goal:** Create Swift models matching database schema and implement Supabase integration

### Session Objectives ✅
- [x] Create Swift data models (Category, Expense) matching existing database
- [x] Set up Supabase Swift Package Manager integration
- [x] Implement SupabaseService with authentication and database operations
